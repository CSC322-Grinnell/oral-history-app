## Project Background ##

## Goals ##


### To-Do ###

Cosmetic changes to the Interviews (Archive) page to match AJ's ideal look
- multi-column/grid display
- less metadata visible for each interview tile (only the name)
More robust testing for website pages and form
 - See /test
A mobile-friendly view
A restricted-access portion of the site accessible only to specific users
 - Build on top of active admin
A site-wide sort and search feature
 - May involve incorporating tags for interviews
 - These tags should not be created by logged-out users
Potentially: a display that incorporates interview location, such as a map
